VduProfile:
  description: The VduProfile describes additional instantiation data for a given VDU used in a DF.
  attributes:
    vdu_id:
      description: Uniquely identifies a VDU.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    min_number_of_instances:
      description: Minimum number of instances of the VNFC based on this VDU that is permitted to exist for this flavour.
      type: Integer
      required: true

    max_number_of_instances:
      description: Maximum number of instances of the VNFC based on this VDU that is permitted to exist for this flavour.
      type: Integer
      required: true


    local_affinity_or_anti_affinity_rule:
      description: Specifies affinity or anti-affinity rules applicable between the virtualisation containers (e.g. virtual machines) to be created based on this VDU. When the cardinality is greater than 1, both affinity rule(s) and anti-affinity rule(s) with different scopes (e.g. "Affinity with the scope resource zone and anti-affinity with the scope NFVI node") are applicable to the virtualisation containers (e.g. virtual machines) to be created based on this VDU.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: LocalAffinityOrAntiAffinityRule

    affinity_or_anti_affinity_group_id:
      description: Identifier(s) of the affinity or anti-affinity group(s) the VDU belongs to.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: Identifier
