Cpd:
  description: A Cpd information element describes network connectivity to a compute resource or a VL. This is an abstract class used as parent for the various Cpd classes.
  attributes:
    cpd_id:
      description: Identifier of this Cpd information element.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    layer_protocol:
      description: Identifies which protocol the CP uses for connectivity purposes (Ethernet, MPLS, ODU2, IPV4, IPV6, Pseudo-Wire, etc.).
      type: Enum
      required: true
      constraints:
        entry_type: String
        valid_values: [ Ethernet, MPLS, ODU2, IPV4, IPV6, Pseudo-Wire ]

    cp_role:
      description: Identifies the role of the port in the context of the traffic flow patterns in the VNF or parent NS. For example a VNF with a tree flow pattern within the VNF will have legal cpRoles of ROOT and LEAF.
      type: String
      required: false

    description:
      description: Provides human-readable information on the purpose of the CP (e.g. CP for control plane traffic).
      type: String
      required: false

    cp_protocol:
      description: Provides human-readble information on the purpose of the CP (e.g. CP for control plane traffic).
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: CpProtocolData

    trunk_mode:
      description: Information about whether the CP instantiated from this CPD is in Trunk mode (802.1Q or other).
      type: Boolean
      required: true
