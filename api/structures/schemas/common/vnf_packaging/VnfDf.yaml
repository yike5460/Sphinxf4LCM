VnfDf:
  description: The VnfDf describes a specific deployment version of a VNF.
  attributes:
    flavour_id:
      description: Identifier of this DF within the VNFD.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    description:
      description: Human readable description of the DF.
      type: String
      required: true

    vdu_profile:
      description: Describes additional instantiation data for the VDUs used in this flavour.
      type: List
      required: true
      constraints:
        entry_type: VduProfile

    virtual_link_profile:
      description: Defines the internal VLD along with additional data which is used in this DF.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: VirtualLinkProfile

    instantiation_level:
      description: Describes the various levels of resources that can be used to instantiate the VNF using this flavour. Examples - Small, Medium, Large. If there is only one instantiationLevel entry, it shall be treated as the default instantiation level for this DF.
      type: List
      required: true
      constraints:
        entry_type: InstantiationLevel

    default_instantiation_level_id:
      description: This attribute references the instantiationLevel entry which defines the default instantiation level for this DF. It shall be present if there are multiple instantiationLevel entries.
      type: Identifier
      required: false

    supported_operation:
      description: Indicates which operations are available for this DF via the VNF LCM interface. Instantiate VNF, Query VNF and Terminate VNF are supported in all DF and therefore need not be included in this list.
      type: Enum
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: NotSpecified

    vnf_lcm_operations_configuration:
      description: Configuration parameters for the VNF Lifecycle Management operations.
      type: VnfLcmOperationsConfiguration
      required: true

    affinity_or_anti_affinity_group:
      description: Specifies affinity or anti-affinity relationship applicable between the virtualisation containers (e.g. virtual machines) to be created using different VDUs or internal VLs to be created using different VnfVirtualLinkDesc(s) in the same affinity or anti-affinity group.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: AffinityOrAntiAffinityGroup

    monitoring_parameter:
      description: Defines the virtualised resources monitoring parameters on VNF level.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: MonitoringParameter

    scaling_aspect:
      description: The scaling aspects supported by this DF of the VNF. scalingAspect shall be present if the VNF supports scaling.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: ScalingAspect
