VirtualLinkProfile:
  description: The VirtualLinkProfile describes additional instantiation data for a given VL used in a DF.
  attributes:
    vnf_virtual_link_desc_id:
      description: Uniquely identifies a Vnf VLD.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    flavour_id:
      description: Identifies a flavour within the VnfVirtualLinkDesc.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    local_affinity_or_anti_affinity_rule:
      description: Specifies affinity or anti-affinity rules applicable between the VLs based on this VnfVirtualLinkDesc. When the cardinality is greater than 1, both affinity rule(s) and anti-affinity rule(s) with different scopes are applicable to the VLs based on this VnfVirtualLinkDesc.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: LocalAffinityOrAntiAffinityRule

    affinity_or_anti_affinity_group_id:
      description: Identifier(s) of the affinity or anti-affinity group(s) the VnfVirtualLinkDesc belongs to.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: Identifier

    max_bit_rate_requirements:
      description: Specifies the maximum bitrate requirements for a VL instantiated according to this profile. See clause 7.1.8.6. See note 2.
      type: LinkBitrateRequirements
      required: true

    min_bit_rate_requirements:
      description: Specifies the minimum bitrate requirements for a VL instantiated according to this profile. See clause 7.1.8.6. See note 2.
      type: LinkBitrateRequirements
      required: true
