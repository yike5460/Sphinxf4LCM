VirtualComputeDesc:
  description: The VirtualComputeDesc information element supports the specification of requirements related to virtual compute resources.
  attributes:
    virtual_compute_desc_id:
      description: CPU architecture type. Examples are x86, ARM. The cardinality can be 0 during the allocation request, if no particular CPU architecture type is requested.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    request_additional_capabilities:
      description: Number of virtual CPUs.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: RequestedAdditionalCapabilityData

    virtual_memory:
      description: Minimum virtual CPU clock rate (e.g. in MHz). The cardinality can be 0 during the allocation request, if no particular value is requested.
      type: VirtualMemoryData
      required: true

    virtual_cpu:
      description: The CPU core oversubscription policy e.g. the relation of virtual CPU cores to physical CPU cores/threads. The cardinality can be 0 during the allocation request, if no particular value is requested.
      type: VirtualCpuData
      required: true
