ScalingAspect:
  description: The ScalingAspect information element describes the details of an aspect used for horizontal scaling.
  attributes:
    id:
      description: Unique identifier of this aspect in the VNFD.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    name:
      description: Human readable name of the aspect.
      type: String
      required: true

    description:
      description: Human readable description of the aspect.
      type: String
      required: true

    associated_group:
      description: Reference to the group of Vnfd elements defining this aspect. If present, scaling for this aspect is limited to the elements of the group, but there is no assumption that all the elements of the groups will be increased at each step.
      type: Identifier
      required: false

    max_scale_level:
      description: The maximum scaleLevel for total number of scaling steps that can be applied w.r.t. this aspect. The value of this attribute corresponds to the number of scaling steps can be applied to this aspect when scaling it from the minimum scale level (i.e. 0) to the maximum scale level defined by this attribute.
      type: PositiveInteger
      required: true

    aspectDeltaDetails:
      description: A specification of the deltas in terms of number of instances of VNFCs and virtual link bit rates that correspond to the scaling steps of this aspect. A cardinality of zero indicates that this mapping has to be specified in a lifecycle management script or be otherwise known to the VNFM.  The information in this attribute, if provided, shall be consistent with the information provided in the "InstantiationLevel" information element. If this attribute is provided, it shall be provided for all scaling
      type: AspectDeltaDetails
      required: false
