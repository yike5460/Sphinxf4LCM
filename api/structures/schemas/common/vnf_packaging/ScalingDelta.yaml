ScalingDelta:
  description: For a particular scaling aspect, the ScalingDelta.yaml information element defines the number of instances per VNFC and the bitrate delta per virtual link that corresponds to a single scaling step. When scaling out by one step, this delta is added to the resources of the VNF instance, whereas when scaling in, this delta is removed.
  attributes:
    vdu_delta:
      description: The number of VNFC instances based on particular VDUs to be created or removed.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: VduLevel

    virtual_link_bit_rate_delta:
      description:  The bitrate to be added or removed to virtual links created from particular virtual link. descriptors.
