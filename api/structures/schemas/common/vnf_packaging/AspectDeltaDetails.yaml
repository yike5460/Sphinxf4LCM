AspectDeltaDetails:
  description: The AspectDeltaDetails information element defines the increments in terms of number of instances of VNFCs and virtual link flavours that correspond to the scaling steps of a scaling aspect
  attributes:
    uniform_delta:
      description: Scaling delta to be applied for every scaling step of this aspect. This attribute allows to model uniform scaling steps.
      type: ScalingDelta
      required: False

    deltas:
      description: Scaling deltas to be applied for the different subsequent scaling steps of this aspect. The first entry in the array shall correspond to the first scaling step (between scale levels 0 to 1) and the last entry of the array shall correspond to the last scaling step (between maxScaleLevel-1 and maxScaleLevel.
      type: List
      required: False
      constraints:
        entry_type: ScalingDelta
