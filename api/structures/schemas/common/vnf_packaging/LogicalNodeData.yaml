LogicalNodeData:
  description: This information element describes compute, memory and I/O requirements that are to be associated with the logical node of infrastructure. The logical node requirements are a sub-component of the VDU level requirements. As an example for illustration purposes, a logical node correlates to the concept of a NUMA cell in libvirt terminology.
  attributes:
    logical_node_requirements:
