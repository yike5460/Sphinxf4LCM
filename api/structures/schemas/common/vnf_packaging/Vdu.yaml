Vdu:
  description: The Virtualisation Deployment Unit (VDU) is a construct supporting the description of the deployment and operational behaviour of a VNFC.
  attributes:
    vdu_id:
      description: Unique identifier of this Vdu in VNFD.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    name:
      description: Human readable name of the Vdu.
      type: String
      required: true

    description:
      description: Human readable description of the Vdu.
      type: String
      required: true

    int_cpd:
      description: Describes network connectivity between a VNFC instance (based on this Vdu) and an internal Virtual Link (VL).
      type: List
      required: true
      constraints:
        entry_type: VduCpd

    virtual_compute_desc:
      description: Describes CPU, Memory and acceleration requirements of the Virtualisation Container realizing this Vdu.
      type: Identifier

    nfvi_constraint:
      description: Describes constraints on the NFVI for the VNFC instance(s) created from this Vdu. For example, aspects of a secure hosting environment for the VNFC instance that involve additional entities or processes.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: String
