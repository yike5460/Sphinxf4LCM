VirtualCpuPinningData:
  description: The VirtualCpuPinningData information element supports the specification of requirements related to the virtual CPU pinning configuration of a virtual compute resource.
  attributes:
    virtual_cpu_pinning_policy:
      description: Indicates the policy for CPU pinning. The policy can take values of "static" or "dynamic". The cardinality can be 0 during the allocation request, if no particular value is requested.
      type: Enum
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: String
        valid_values: [ static, dynamic ]

    virtual_cpu_pinning_map:
      description: If cpuPinningPolicy is defined as "static", the cpuPinningMap provides the map of pinning virtual CPU cores to physical CPU cores/threads. Cardinality is 0 if cpuPinningPolicy has a different value than "static".
      type: NotSpecified
      required: false
