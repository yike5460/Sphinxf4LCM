VirtualCpuData:
  description: The VirtualCpuData information element supports the specification of requirements related to virtual CPU(s) of a virtual compute resource.
  attributes:
    cpu_architecture:
      description: CPU architecture type. Examples are x86, ARM. The cardinality can be 0 during the allocation request, if no particular CPU architecture type is requested.
      type: String
      required: false

    num_virtual_cpu:
      description: Number of virtual CPUs.
      type: Integer
      required: true

    virtual_cpu_clock:
      description: Minimum virtual CPU clock rate (e.g. in MHz). The cardinality can be 0 during the allocation request, if no particular value is requested.
      type: Number
      required: false

    virtual_cpu_oversubscription_policy:
      description: The CPU core oversubscription policy e.g. the relation of virtual CPU cores to physical CPU cores/threads. The cardinality can be 0 during the allocation request, if no particular value is requested.
      type: NotSpecified
      required: false

    vdu_cpu_requirements:
      description: The CPU core oversubscription policy e.g. the relation of virtual CPU cores to physical CPU cores/threads. The cardinality can be 0 during the allocation request, if no particular value is requested.
      type: NotSpecified
      required: true

    virtual_cpu_pinning:
      description: The virtual CPU pinning configuration for the virtualised compute resource.
      type: VirtualCpuPinningData
      required: false
