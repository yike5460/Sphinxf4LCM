NsLevel:
  description: The NsLevel information element describes the details of an NS level. An NS level consists of a list of involved entities, i.e. VNFs, VLs and/or nested NSs. For each involved VNF/nested NS, the number of instances required by the NS level is specified. For each involved VL, the bitrate requirements corresponding to the NS level are specified.
  attributes:
    ns_level_id:
      description: Identifier of this NsLevel information element. It uniquely identifies an NS level within the DF.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    description:
      description: Human readable description of the NS level.
      type: String
      required: true

    vnf_to_level_mapping:
      description: Specifies the profile of the VNFs involved in this NS level and, for each of them, the required number of instances.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: VnfToLevelMapping

    virtual_link_to_level_mapping:
      description: Specifies the profile of the VLs involved in this NS level and, for each of them, the needed bandwidth.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: VirtualLinkToLevelMapping
