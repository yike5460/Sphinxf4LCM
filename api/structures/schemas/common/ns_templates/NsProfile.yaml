NsProfile:
  description: The NsLevel information element describes the details of an NS level. An NS level consists of a list of involved entities, i.e. VNFs, VLs and/or nested NSs. For each involved VNF/nested NS, the number of instances required by the NS level is specified. For each involved VL, the bitrate requirements corresponding to the NS level are specified.
  attributes:
    ns_profile_id:
      description: Identifier of this NsLevel information element. It uniquely identifies an NS level within the DF.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    nsd_id:
      description: Identifies the NSD applicable to NS instantiated according to this profile.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    ns_instantiation_level_id:
      description: Identifies the NS level within the referenced NS DF to be used in the context of the parent NS instantiation. If not present, the default NS instantiation level as declared in the referenced NSD shall be used.
      type: Identifier
      required: false

    min_number_of_instances:
      description: Minimum number of nested NS instances based on the referenced NSD that is permitted to exist for this NsProfile.
      type: Integer
      required: true

    max_number_of_instances:
      description: Maximum number of nested NS instances based on the referenced NSD that is permitted to exist for this NSProfile.
      type: Integer
      required: true

    affinity_or_anti_affinity_group_id:
      description: Identifies an affinity or anti-affinity group the NSs created according to this NSProfile belong to.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: Identifier

    ns_virtual_link_connectivity:
      description: Defines the connection information of the NS, it contains connection relationship between an NS SAP and a NS virtual Link of the composite NS.
      type: List
      required: true
      constraints:
        entry_type: NsVirtualLinkConnectivity
