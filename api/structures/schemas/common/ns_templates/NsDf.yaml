NsDf:
  description: The NsDf information element specifies the properties of a variant of an NS.
  attributes:
    ns_df_id:
      description: Identifies this NsDf information element. It identifies a NS DF within the NSD.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    flavour_key:
      description: Assurance parameter against which this flavour is being described. The key can be a combination of multiple assurance parameters with a logical relationship between them. The parameters should be present as a monitoredInfo attribute in the NSD.

    pnf_profile:
      description: PNF profile to be used for the NS flavour.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: PnfProfile

    virtual_link_profile:

      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: NsScalingAspect

    affinity_or_anti_affinity_group:
      description: Specifies affinity or anti-affinity relationship applicable between the VNF instances created using different VNFDs, the Virtual Link instances created using different NsVirtualLinkDescs or the nested NS instances created using different NSDs in the same affinity or anti-affinity group.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: NsAffinityOrAntiAffinityGroup

      required: true
      constraints:
        entry_type: NsLevel

    default_ns_instantiation_level_id:
      description: Identifies the NS level which represents the default NS instantiation level for this DF. It shall be present if there are multiple "nsIinstantiationLevel" entries.
      type: Identifier
      required: false

    ns_profile:
      description: Specifies a NS Profile supported by this NS DF.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: NsProfile

    dependencies:
