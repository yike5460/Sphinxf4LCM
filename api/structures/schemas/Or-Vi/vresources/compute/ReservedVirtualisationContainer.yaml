ReservedVirtualisationContainer:
  description: This clause describes the attributes for the ReservedVirtualisationContainer information element.

  attributes:
    container_id:
      description: The identifier of the virtualisation container that has been reserved.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    flavour_id:
      description: Identifier of the given compute flavour used to reserve the virtualisation container.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    acceleration_capability:
      description: Selected acceleration capabilities (e.g. crypto, GPU) from the set of capabilities offered by the compute node acceleration resources. The cardinality can be 0, if no particular acceleration capability is provided.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: String

    virtual_memory:
      description: The virtual memory of the reserved virtualisation container.
      type: VirtualMemory
      required: true

    virtual_cpu:
      description: The virtual CPU(s) of the reserved virtualisation container.
      type: VirtualCpu
      required: true

    virtual_disks:
      description: Element with information of the virtualised storage resources attached to the reserved virtualisation container.
      type: List
      required: true
      constraints:
        entry_type: VirtualStorage

    virtual_network_interface:
      description: Element with information of the virtual network interfaces of the reserved virtualisation container.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: VirtualNetworkInterface

    zone_id:
      description: References the resource zone where the virtualisation container has been reserved. Cardinality can be 0 to cover the case where reserved network resources are not bound to a specific resource zone.
      type: Identifier
      required: false
