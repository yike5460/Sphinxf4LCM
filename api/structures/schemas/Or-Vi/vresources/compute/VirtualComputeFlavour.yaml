VirtualComputeFlavour:
  description: The VirtualComputeFlavour information element encapsulates information for compute flavours. A compute flavour includes information about number of virtual CPUs, size of virtual memory, size of virtual storage, and virtual network interfaces. The NetworkInterfaceType information element encapsulates information of a virtual network interface for a compute resource.

  attributes:
    flavour_id:
      description: Identifier given to the compute flavour.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    acceleration_capability :
      description: Selected acceleration capabilities (e.g. crypto, GPU) from the set of capabilities offered by the compute node acceleration resources. The cardinality can be 0, if no particular acceleration capability is requested.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: String

    virtual_memory:
      description: The virtual memory of the virtualised compute.
      type: VirtualMemory
      required: true

    virtual_cpu:
      description: The virtual CPU(s) of the virtualised compute.
      type: VirtualCpu
      required: true

    storage_attributes:
      description: Element containing information about the size of virtualised storage resource (e.g. size of volume, in GB), the type of storage (e.g. volume, object), and support for RDMA.
      type: VirtualStorageData
      required: false

    virtual_network_interface:
      description: The virtual network interfaces of the virtualised compute.
      type: VirtualNetworkInterfaceData
      required: false
