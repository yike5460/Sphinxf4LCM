      description: Identifier of the given compute flavour used to instantiate this virtual compute
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    acceleration_capability:
      description: Selected acceleration capabilities (e.g. crypto, GPU) from the set of capabilities offered by the compute node acceleration resources. The cardinality can be 0, if no particular acceleration capability is provided.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:

      required: true

    virtual_memory:
      description: The virtual memory of the compute. See clause 8.4.3.5.
      type: VirtualMemory
      required: true

    virtual_network_interface:
      description: Element with information of the instantiated virtual network interfaces of the compute resource. See clause 8.4.3.6.

      constraints:
        entry_type: VirtualStorage

    vc_image_id:
      description: Identifier of the virtualisation container software image (e.g. virtual machine image). Cardinality can be 0 if an "empty" virtualisation container is allocated.
