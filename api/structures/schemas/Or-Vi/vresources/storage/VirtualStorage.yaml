VirtualStorage:
  description: The VirtualStorage information element encapsulates information of an instantiated virtualised storage resource.
  attributes:
    storage_id:
      description: Identifier of the virtualised storage resource.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    storage_name:
      description: Name of the virtualised storage resource.
      type: String
      required: false

    flavour_id:
      description: Identifier of the storage flavour used to instantiate this virtual storage.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    type_of_storage:
      description: Type of virtualised storage resource (e.g. volume, object).
      type: String
      required: true

    size_of_storage:
