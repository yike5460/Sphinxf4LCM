VirtualNetworkPortReservationData:
  description: This clause describes the attributes for the VirtualNetworkPortReservationData information element.
  attributes:
    port_id:
      description: Identifier of the network port to reserve.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    port_type:
      description: Type of network port. Examples of types are access ports, or trunk ports (layer 1) that become transport for multiple layer 2 or layer 3 networks.
      type: Enum
      required: true
      constraints:
        entry_type: String
        valid_values: [ ACCESS, TRUNK ]

    segment_id:
      description: The isolated segment the network port belongs to. For instance, for a "vlan", it corresponds to the vlan identifier; and for a "gre", this corresponds to a gre key. The cardinality can be 0 to allow for flat networks without any specific segmentation.
      type: String
      required: false

    bandwidth:
      description: The bitrate of the virtual network port (in Mbps).
      type: Number
      required: false

    metadata:
      description: List of metadata key-value pairs used by the consumer to associate meaningful metadata to the related virtualised resource.
      type: Mapping
      required: false
