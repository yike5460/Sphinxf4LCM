VirtualNetworkInterfaceData:
  description: A virtual network interface is a communication endpoint under a compute resource.
  attributes:
    network_id:
      description: In the case when the virtual network interface is attached to the network, it identifies such a network. The cardinality can be 0 in the case that a network interface is created without being attached to any specific network.
      type: Identifier
      required: false

    network_port_id:
      description: If the virtual network interface is attached to a specific network port, it identifies such a network port. The cardinality can be 0 in the case that a network interface is created without any specific network port attachment.
      type: Identifier
      required: false

    ip_address:
      description: The virtual network interface can be configured with specific IP address(es) associated to the network to be attached to. The cardinality can be 0 in the case that a network interface is created without being attached to any specific network, or when an IP address can be automatically configured, e.g. by DHCP.
      type: IpAddress
      required: false

    type_virtual_nic:
      description: Type of network interface. The type allows for defining how such interface is to be realized, e.g. normal virtual NIC, with direct PCI passthrough, etc.
      type: String
      required: true

    type_configuration:
      description: Extra configuration that the virtual network interface supports based on the type of virtual network interface, including support for SR-IOV with configuration of virtual functions (VF).
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: String

    mac_address:
      description: The MAC address desired for the virtual network interface. The cardinality can be 0 to allow for network interface without specific MAC address configuration.
      type: MacAddress
      required: false

    bandwidth:
      description: The bandwidth of the virtual network interface (in Mbps).
      type: Number
      required: false

    acceleration_capability:
      description: It specifies if the virtual network interface requires certain acceleration capabilities (e.g. RDMA, packet dispatch, TCP Chimney).
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: String

    metadata:
      description: List of metadata key-value pairs used by the consumer to associate meaningful metadata to the related virtualised resource.
      type: Mapping
      required: false
