VirtualNetwork:
  description: This clause describes the attributes for the VirtualNetwork information element.
  attributes:
    network_resource_id:
      description: Identifier of the virtualised network resource.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    network_resource_name:
      description: Name of the virtualised network resource.
      type: String
      required: false

    subnet:
      description: Only present if the network provides layer 3 connectivity. See clause 8.4.5.3.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: Identifier

    network_port:
      description: Element providing information of an instantiated virtual network port.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: VirtualNetworkPort

    bandwidth:
      description: Minimum network bandwidth (in Mbps).
      type: Number
      required: true

    network_type:
      description: The type of network that maps to the virtualised network. This list is extensible. Examples are "local", "vlan", "vxlan", "gre", "l3-vpn", etc.
      type: String
      required: true

    segment_type:
      description: The isolated segment for the virtualised network. For instance, for a "vlan" networkType, it corresponds to the vlan identifier; and for a "gre" networkType, this corresponds to a gre key. The cardinality can be "0" for flat networks without any specific segmentation.
      type: String
      required: false

    network_qos:
      description: Element providing information about Quality of Service attributes that the network supports. See clause 8.4.4.3. Cardinality can be "0" for virtual network without any QoS requirements.
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: NetworkQoS

    is_shared:
      description: It defines whether the virtualised network is shared among consumers.
      type: Boolean
      required: true

    sharing_criteria:
      description: Only present for shared networks. Indicate the sharing criteria for this network. This criteria might be a list of authorized consumers.
      type: NotSpecified
      required: false

    zone_id:
      description: If present, it identifies the Resource Zone where the virtual network resources have been allocated.
      type: Identifier
      required: false

    operational_state:
      description: The operational state of the virtualised network.
      type: Enum
      required: true
      constraints:
        entry_type: String
        valid_values: [ ENABLED, DISABLED ]

    metadata:
      description: List of metadata key-value pairs used by the consumer to associate meaningful metadata to the related virtualised resource.
      type: Mapping
      required: false
