VirtualNetworkPort:
  description: The VirtualNetworkPort information element encapsulates information of an instantiated virtual network port. A network port resource is a communication endpoint instantiated under a network resource.
  attributes:
    resource_id:
      description: Identifier of the virtual network port.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    network_id:
      description: Identifier of the network that the port belongs to. When creating a port, such port needs to be part of a network.
      type: Identifier
      required: true

    attached_resource_id:
      description: Identifier of the attached resource to the network port (e.g. a virtualised compute resource, or identifier of the virtual network interface). The cardinality can be "0" if there is no specific resource connected to the network port.
      type: Identifier
      required: false

    port_type:
      description: Type of network port. Examples of types are access ports (layer 2 or 3), or trunk ports (layer 1) that become transport for multiple layer 2 or layer 3 networks.
      type: String
      required: true

    segment_id:
      description: The isolated segment the network port belongs to. For instance, for a "vlan", it corresponds to the vlan identifier; and for a "gre", this corresponds to a gre key. The cardinality can be "0" for flat networks without any specific segmentation.
      type: Identifier
      required: false

    bandwidth:
      description: The bandwidth of the virtual network port (in Mbps). Cardinality can be "0" for virtual network ports without any specific allocated bandwidth.
      type: Number
      required: false

    operational_state:
      description: The operational state of the virtual network port.
      type: Enum
      required: true
      constraints:
        entry_type: String
        valid_values: [ ENABLED, DISABLED ]

    metadata:
      description: List of metadata key-value pairs used by the consumer to associate meaningful metadata to the related virtualised resource.
      type: Mapping
      required: false
