ScaleNsData:
  description: The ScaleNsData information element describes the information needed to scale an NS instance either by explicitly adding/removing existing VNF instances or by leveraging on the abstraction mechanism provided by the NS scaling aspects and NS levels information elements declared in the NSD
  attributes:
    vnf_instance_to_be_added:
      description: Specifies an existing VNF instance to be added to the NS instance as part of the scaling operation. If needed, the VNF Profile to be used for this VNF instance is also provided
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: VnfInstanceData

    vnf_instance_to_be _removed:
      description: Specifies a VNF instance to be removed from the NS instance as part of the scaling operation
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: Identifier

    scale_ns_by_steps_data:
      description: Specifies the information needed to scale an NS instance by one or more scaling steps
      type: ScaleNsByStepsData
      required: false

    scale_ns_to_level_data:
      description: Specifies the information needed to scale an NS instance to a target size
      type: ScaleNsToLevelData
      required: false

    additional_param_for_ns:
      description: Allows the OSS/BSS to provide additional parameter(s) at the NS level necessary for the NS scaling
      type: Mapping
      required: false

    additional_param_for_vnf:
      description: Allows the OSS/BSS to provide additional parameter(s) per VNF instance
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: ParamsForVnf

    location_constraints:
      description: Defines the location constraints for the VNF to be instantiated as part of the NS scaling
      type: List
      required: false
      constraints:
        entry_type: VnfLocationConstraint
